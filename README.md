# 883Project
The version of networkx we use is 1.10.

Please read the run.py first.
Here is a list of features the networkx library has:
1. adar
2. jaccard
3. Preferential attachment
4. pagerank
5. maximum flow
6. betweenness centrality
7. core Number
8. common neighbors

The negative testing edges are created so that the 2 nodes are at a distance of 2: the reason is that if randomly connected two nodes in the graph, the accuary obtained using common neighbors alone is 99%.
